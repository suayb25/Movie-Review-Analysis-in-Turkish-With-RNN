The festivals attended by this film are distributed among the prizes given by the film, the sincerity in the narrative, the pleasure taken from the movie, and the fact that although the actors are new and trivial names, they do not include anything in the film and they all had this film.;;;

to congratulate a film so warm and sincere that he has done a very nice job that John uluçeyi show that if the directors enough budgets are presented to what they do ......... Anyway I recommend to everyone;;;
"A very nice movie ...

I think the taste of watermelon in the palate, a film that makes you want to make a film: D: D: D;;;
war or action side, in the shadow of the love side, worth watching a movie;;;
I was very excited in the middle. The first film is played in the movies so that they are playing so well that they have in the film. When I was retired when I went to a village so peaceful that I got your message :) I was so excited that I ended up with a very nice bi but I didn&#39;t expect it but I had a lot of dreams in the movie after all;;
The health of the person who made a perfect film was a perfect natural (I was crying);;;
Really good movie;;;
an impressive film tells the impossible love of a British and an Irishman. But the soundtrack couldn&#39;t be chosen well. No good funding behind the movie. Music&#39;s almost gone.;
"there is hope in life to taste something. ahmet uluçayda is the creator of hope. In the dimension of dreaming, we all had to lie down in our childhood in the childhood. ahmet ulucay is one of us and it reflects it nice to every theme used throughout the film was in beauty. The film&#39;s title is the title of the film. thanks to each and every person who contributed to their work.";;;
"I think it is a good film in its own branch, watching only the end of the film, you&#39;ll understand that the 2nd will be withdrawn, which I hope will be removed already.";;;
"When you watch the movie, you&#39;re caught in the flow. It&#39;s a super adventure and love movie. It is impossible to get bored while watching because it is processed in 2 categories :)";;;

"Combat and love reunion Braveheart&#39;s likes this film, but the war scenes remain faint, showing how the honorable br lover can be.";;;
a natural and warm film was very nice ..;;;
The film is a film with a bold heart-like taste, although it is not a movie that contains as much war as it is.;;;
A beautiful movie of the combination of war and love.;;;
I watched the movie I think it would be a boring movie I would like to see a successful movie horror is not a horror, but an immersive tension more than what could be so successful even if you're doing a criticism let's see if this film is good but good;;;
an amazing combination of love and history;;;
An emotional and dramatic story, a striking love affair, a reciprocal love affair, having things to do with the film.;;;
An impressive love adventure drama movie. You can watch with pleasure.;;;
to share your loved one but I suppose it can be so bad ... this movie is especially james franco it so güsell mirrored.;;;
If you want to watch an emotional movie, it's the right movie.;;;
it was a movie that deeply touched me .. love, betrayal, intrigue .. everything was in this film .. good in the scenario .. the dialogues between the girls and the boy in the movie impressed me .. I think a very nice film .. strictly monitored;;;
It was a movie that changed my point of view. A movie that affects the lives of every human being is a book an event or a song that is one of them. Love will be strengthened with your lover.;;;
It was one of the hottest and most natural films I've ever seen …;;;
a movie that you will find yourself in romance and passion when watching. When you think of the period, you can stay between the loyalty and love of the king, you cannot avoid your love, you are a passionate love, a noble king who is in love with the king who respects the love despite everything. There's been a nice movie in the world.;;;
love I and passion have described perfectly. masterpiece. Watch the original and original images. 10/10;;;
Karpian apprentice with the receptacle of the watermelon. The poetry fighters of the war of existence and existence. These children loved the fires. and the film that strolls between the strips of the street of the cat. Life is the representation of life. and squares attached to the can .... a whole new childhood ...;;;
war, love and drama together in a very good way. ;;;
The movie is really perfect with one word really a 10 number one movie I need to appreciate that this movie was made really appreciated in many difficulties;;;

The film is really good.Greg kinnear is so ticky as the role it plays, it gives the right in the toni collette.Although the field arkin, it should be appreciated in Steve Carrell. we know that we too in turkey & quot bilmiyorum.bel;;;
I've been looking for a long time and finally find and watch the movie. Real cinema audiences, the film archive, not only Hollywood movies and music lovers who should watch everyone who watches a great film.I strongly recommend …;;;
The movie is really different and beautiful as the screenplay, but the best movie is not so far as to take the best film ii the film gets the departed but the last of the queen;;;
One of Oscar's biggest candidates. The script and fiction that you put in, even if you don't want to watch it again, is great. Follow Us;;;

Don't be fooled by the bad comments that the fruit-bearing tree is stoned on. simply flawless. It was perfect.;;;
Francis Ford Coppola is a legendary movie classic ... A project that is close to perfection with everything. An art event that should be seen before death ...;;;
I found his book beautiful as a man who reads. His players have given up their roles, some places are not true, but ultimately it is not possible to fully adapt a 1000-page book.;;;
and the oscar goes to natalie portman ;;;
Best film I've ever seen. I was very surprised when I read the comments. I couldn't understand my friends talking about recep ivediktenmi watching another film.;;;

like a fairy tale, like poetry, like music, like dancing, singing in the rain, a movie like a movie ... the best of musicals.;;;
osman exam usually does not surprise the movie is doing a beautiful film …;;;
a wonderful transient film tells how much difficulty is encountered in the transition from silent cinema to audio cinema.;;;
a beautiful film that encourages watching. In fact, some people are lucky from birth so I have to find someone and kiss immediately: Pp;;;
The work they do respect ... And also the state will come against ... Of course they are not in our country, the United States ... Otherwise we go to the state without ruining the people ... My dear country, my people, my nation ... It was still beautiful ..;;;
the perfect film in this film to give up the bored ones in the way of the event in such a way that you do not even understand that the time has passed;;;
THE MOST MOVIE OF THE BENCE DÝZÝ FILM PROJECT;;;
Good scenario is actually ... slow slow moving a little bit to the end of the confusing at the end not just say hýmm say aaaa come to say no, will not leave you a movie. .. follow the follow you'll hear no remorse.;;;
I had read the book before watching this film and I was incredibly impressed. but be sure to read the book ahead but surely.;;;
Wonderful film. Sadness, comedy, horses in short, everything I love. In my opinion, it deserves more oscars than the fanciful Oscar films. Would recommend to those who do not watch. 10/10;;;
Stephen King fans are very normal to be disappointed. because this film is a little more intense film noir type enters the work. I found the very successful story very provocative. The film describes a writer's syndromes very well. the fact that we anticipate the end does not reduce the coefficient of pleasure. 8/10;;;
The film is really nice, nice and effective scenes, but I did not get the end of the film, but I watch a movie that is not enough to watch at least johnny depp enough for the film;;;
The first scenes are very funny. In general terms is very fun and as usual funny.;;;
strictly monitored! I watched and added to my archive 10/10;;;
I can't believe that the film was made in 1981, I can bet it was a film that was shot in the 2000s.;;;
a film that needs to be traced.;;;
The perfect movie in the history of cinema among the best war films. I watched him in the military. A German submarine crew is struggling to survive for months on end. The end of the movie is super or .... I would take this movie Oscar but I didn't say political reasons ...;;;
It was one of those rare films that I didn't know why the crying came.;;;
The perfect management of Martin Scorsese, the complete performance of the cast and the successful film-comedy of our hero Paul Hacket with the salvation that will take place in the minds ... I watched with pleasure and curiosity from the beginning ... was also the most different and interesting film of Martin Scorsese. 10/8 should .izlen ...;;;
Jason Statham ..... this man is increasingly increasing his popularity, and soon he will become a sought after actor.;;;
I could only watch it today. I think it was really nice and impressive making one. Even though some points created a question mark, I decided to read the book and I'm sure I would find the answer. But a film to be watched is a great opportunity to catch a different culture even if it is not for nothing.;;;
it was absolutely great too. Especially the cookies were very nice;;;
I was expecting a great final, according to the film's progress ... but I'm disappointed ... but I still like the film!;;;
I was more interested in the book than Da Vinci. I hope the movie will be much nicer. We eagerly await.;;;
was one of the most beautiful films I have watched ... the subject was different, the dialogues in the movie were very nice and the movie was full of mad world song ... but one of my favorite points was the end ... the movie was super finished ... so bad end, with an unexpected end. ..;;;
I like that movie. I've seen it three times.;;;
I love filming. If you knew your future, what you would have chosen would result in my head. fate, a film that passed the quantum, a film.;;;
After watching some movies, it takes a few hours or even a couple of days to occupy your head, for me it wasn't one of those films, but with a traceable gripping, it's a beautiful film, though, I think it's 7 out of 10.;;;
I watched .. very fun and funny film .. good is cikarmislar .. matthewin is oksi girls hardly gusel valla .. in the meantime there is a scene watching the film .. The same Blof game we played.;;;
Edward Norton is an amazing movie that has done a very good job, definitely follow it and don't go out with negative comments. usually the negative comments of the film friends do not know what the film is not in the audience of this film and they see the right to comment themselves in short, all films have such a negative task of making a negative comment I do not understand. this film is already making you wonder when they will be doing more.;;;
legends do not become legendary legends are already done with this going to stallone to finish this legend is doing its best to keep alive. The old movies always keep alive in the legend. If you follow, you will see that the nostargic have done much posting on the old parts. Stallone has added a different dimension to the legend in this movie I hope I won't have a next episode, because this work has a rematch :);;;
Perfect film. A great directing genius. The great performance of Gunnar Björnstrand as Jöns and his lines in the film are truly incredible. it's not a movie for everyone. loss of time for most. but this beautiful film of the great master is a complete phenomenon for true cinema lovers ...;;;
I agree with the ideas of our friends.;;;
beyond excellent;;;
is undoubtedly the masterpiece of cinema history. you have to watch;;;
I'm not exaggerating in my life I can say one of the best films. It is a complete masterpiece. I'm not surprised that Oscar took. A film that can be followed again, dusting in the archives.;;;
the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life;;;
it is definitely at the top of the movies not to be missed. It's a movie that deserves credit.;;;
the film was nice but the first half was a bit boring The second half was nice;;;
He's got an air that doesn't bother you. Good jokes. Too optimistic. The first was obviously better. Penguins are still the best helper characters in my work in the animation 8/10;;;
Film is really great, such immersive, difficult to come to mind in the film will be very few in the film. I have been successful in every movie in a movie that Affleck successful actor. 90 years of successful actress. .... .I think it's your problem in the film and Ben Affleck.;;;
I think a very nice animation is not only kids but I think it should follow 10 adults 10 out of 10 animation;;;
I guess I've been touched ... But I'm still touched.;;;
Do not think as the age limit is recommended should follow big little everyone ...;;;
If anyone likes cinema or not, everyone should watch Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump has gone beyond a film with his book. In schools, it is recommended that teachers be advised by students. I don't need to praise the film, fuss or exaggerate. Forrest Gump.;;;
I have to watch everyone who wants to love the classic …;;;
Such movies are not really my style, but there is something that attracts me in this movie.;;;
A wonderful, wonderful masterpiece of great cinema …;;;
Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman show off their best performance in their cinema career. With its cleverly written script, its excitement is increasing and the surprise finale shakes you with the film. I still say that he's missing a lot.;;;
follow a super masterpiece;;;
I didn't watch this time because there is no action in the movie. However, the action in the film is exactly given in the dose. This story is true, that is not fantastic science fiction, so what would they have done. I think it will be an important place among the gangster films.;;;
I think it's a nice action film to spend a nice time. Don't mind the ones who call it a fiasco for the movie !!!;;;
I hope David Yates makes me laugh in this film of the series. It would be good to publish it as a part of the movie. I think it would be different to the film and it would be a film more connected to my book.;;;
Tom Cruise is a very good player. she is still self-evident.;;;
A great movie is truly flawless favor Briony's 13-18 year old and old-fashioned sat in the wet müzik cinematography was so good and the music was great yaþ Oscar is already snatched n 10/10 my favorite ... definitely follow!;;;
I think Vincent must be among the 100 most attractive characters in the history of cinema. It is neither the gun grip nor the blinking eye, the silver fox, as Tom Cruisen said, or the little glamorous devil he was afraid to even meet Stalin. The film is a complete digital camera wonder, especially if it doesn't have a club scene, Vincent is a scene that changes its size and becomes a superhuman entity, Davis Miles chat, the mood of the characters ... In short, a great movie ..........;;;
he is still a hot sequel film that carries the beautiful first film to much more beautiful places.;;;
Before sunset, I don't know if I've come to you enough, but it's not enough I didn't want the film to end, but I wouldn't be more of a sequel.;;;
a heavy but never bored movie to watch. the last scene is surprising people with surprises. 8/10;;;
 The film is far from gripping, but still a beautiful movie, the costumes are super cool and the seriousness of the talk is super, it's worth watching for Blanchett.;;;
One of my favorites …;;;
paris is not one of my favorite cities is still not. but this movie after the cities I want to see between the small number of images in this film. It is not more beautiful, but 9 years of waiting for the film you do not pay attention to the shouting of the film. Therefore film is more attractive than the first film.;;;
the cate blanchett was absolutely fantastic …;;;
The subject of this film I approached without any expectation and without any doubt was very nice.;;;
Quality fun ... Watch if you have time …;;;
Kevin Costner's favorite movie. A film that really needs to be watched;;;
It was really nice to say the best of the movies I watched this time.;;;
excellent;;;
 I've never seen this movie before. I usually prefer to look for high-quality movies from a site. In this film she had a high score, but wasn't popular. After watching, maybe they should be on the main page. Buddha clearly explains what I think of the film ... :);;;
The film was like this or do not want to write long so long as it was absolutely everyone should watch absolutely ... 9/10;;;
 the most beautiful film I've been watching lately. the scenario is perfectly thought out, the acting is great. a film that really needs to be watched. be sure to follow ...;;;
the second best vampire movie in a single word with the best vampire film I'll put the vampire in the first place ...;;;
 first in the movie category number one ... there is a scene in the film when traveling with the child as the time travel describes the journey from the back of the car past the time, car progress and the future when looking at the road ... butch by car stands and says that the current time .. You're a whip ... clint eastwood, and every film that he directs seems to be a masterpiece.;;;
 The banana acting super..cate blanceht gives the next signal for the first film so it is not perfect. a film that we must sukretmemýz must be a sword. france has very heavy references in the film .. The biggest element that destroys societies is showing that the end of the air. watch me watch;;;
 Bram Stockerdan adaptation, Francis Ford Coppol, perhaps the best film after The Godfatherdan. Gaty Oldman exhibited a magnificent performance. His subject and expression was a masterful job. The best Dracula-Campir film I've ever seen. It can't be better. 10 / 9.5;;;
 super superficial;;;
 The end of the film could be a little shorter but also very nice in general very nice in particular ...;;;
A delightful film is a successful romantic comedy that can be seen without getting bored. One of the best in my own style.;;;
I think it was the best filmdi.ben the last movie I have made in recent years contains the tension and mystery. Depp is still the talked about actress.You will not regret it.;;;
 a film worth touching;;;
When I watched this movie for the first time, I was more childish and my eyes were swollen.It is really nice to add to the pages of Eyazperde.com.;;;
 It is very sad that this film is added so late in this movie ... Most of the film is filmed to the classic film.;;;
 A cult horror film.;;;
 I thought the romantic comic movie was good, but I think everyone was hanging around. I suggest you follow the romantic and funny work as the little actor of the movie said in the movie. I also watched the first love movie in spite of other foreign films in view of supporting the Turkish people.;;;
 a film that needs to be watched. There are two faces of man kevin costner.;;;
I enjoyed it very nice, especially the Aegean is a very cute and a nice film;;;
 I stayed at the last steps of Desem where I grew up at the last minute with the glasses or the lenses that the doctor gave me recently. I always like to watch movies as a whole, as a whole with the film, this change has disturbed my sense of comfort a little, but I couldn't suppress my other feelings throughout the film.;;;
 what a lovely movie what a wonderfully funny what wonderful romantic ...;;;
Just a great movie! so much fun. the quality of the film is already clear. Do not be fooled by the words of those who make a negative yprum and I think I follow. it is extremely immersive and allows people to have a nice time. lindsay is also very sweet, and she's perfectly suited to her role.;;;
 It was very nice in the music that I watched with pleasure in a very romantic romance.;;;
 Film, thriller and horror novelist Stephen King's 'Midnight 2 Pass' book 'Hidden Window-Secret Garden' story adapted from the story of Jurassic Park, Our Mission Danger, Lost World: Jurassic Park 2, Spiderman films such as David Koepp's second directorial feature, Secret Window. The successful actress Jonnhy Deep is written and directed by David Koepp, as well as some of the best actors like Jon Turturo, Mario Bello, Tim Underhil. The story of Stephen King, written in the early '90s, was the finest thriller of 2004.;;;
 a movie that can be watched with pleasure: D;;;
 great fun absolutely recommend ediorm;;;

 I like Lindsay Lohan and I think he's done a good job in this movie. chris pine i am a beginner in princess 2 already and i am very happy to see her again in a movie. it was funny and entertaining film, I was bored in very few episodes, but a movie to be watched;;;
 The film was shot very closely (10 mt alongside my place of work). I have a very good quality people and a hard working staff. I thought it would do a job.;;;
 It's a fun, fun, romantic comedy. I think one of Lindsay Lohan's best films ...;;;
 follow a beautiful movie I think ben 10 werdim;;;
The best film in the world. But the best part of the film.;;;
A great romantic comedy with great fun deserves 9 out of 9.;;;
 I had just watched on TV for the first time in my little life, and I was really frightened c that day no movie has ever scared me as much as cry. Especially the first 1 and the second one were awesome. güzeldi..4. I heard the movie comes.;;;
 The best and funniest movie of super lilo.;;;
 A beautiful and fun movie.;;;
I'm guessing this movie has taken everyone to their own child. But a beautiful film ... But I do not understand why there are a lot of scenes ... Now that I have a lot of international award-winning movies in my mind confused the idea that I have missed something ... Example The woman came to me at the beginning of the fires, the shadows moving in the narrow streets came to me like unnecessary tensions.;;;
lindsay lohana is a beautiful movie that can admire the lohana.;;;
a beautiful youth comedy movie, funny, amusing young people or American telling. I think you will enjoy the young, but it does not attract the attention of outside viewers.;;;
A great movie. I have also read and liked the book. The film is also very beautiful. Man watching the external world disconnects it, it is extremely gripping ... I'm looking for a DVD now, and I will add it to the archive when I find it.;;;
 I watched the film was very sweet and very beautiful film ... WATCH FOLLOW ...;;;
I think there are many beautiful funny scenes from the best youth comedies of my last time. When you look at the other bi people can draw a lot from this movie (especially in the youth age) ... both tutorial! both comma;;;
 A very good work in terms of acting as well as the creation of a complete construction hugo's work very well interpreted. the final scene was really super good if it was taken very well ...;;;
 I recommend to watch it was great;;;
A film shot in impossibilities and not based on the cast of the star system, could it be so beautiful, and so far behind the many domestic and foreign films that have been shot in the million dollars? I know what the film is in. I would like to thank Ahmet Uluçay and other laborers for taking this film, which I found very successful as a student of communication faculty. this film taught us once again the victory of perseverance and patience. I would like to say to everyone who loves cinema that we have to be supportive to Ahmet Uluçay and other directors and screenwriters like him, who come up to us with his sympathetic personality and creative spirit. It was a very intimate movie. To win the vessels from the watermelon shell deserves to end. I look forward to the new movies of the director. I would recommend everyone to the movie ... good cinema days :));;;
 It's a book and a movie of my life. But after reading the book, it may be a little disappointing to watch the movie, but it is a film that is well adapted from the book. I am very impressed by the character of the movie.;;;
 one of the most meaningful films I've seen in my life, especially the escape scenes or the last scenes were the most impressive.;;;
 recently I watched the most one of the Turkish flmler. One is not very strong, but everything is very natural, sincere and cheerful. I think in a way ulucay will create his own style and like the six-person mustafa think that the director will not be like himself.;;;
 I wish I had already convinced two of his friends to go.;;;
 If you read the novel and think it in the film you're mistaken because I'm mistaken to watch the film in the beginning of watching the film because you can not live in the movie while reading the book, but for two hours already, but it is not enough hours to tell the book. I would recommend but this movie is not too bad to eat the right so you should not eat the sacred films around you may sound like this medicine :);;;
We read a book from our own imagination, the film is watching from the director. I think that the film is adapted to the scenario in the most beautiful way you can tell in 2.30 hours. Leem Neeson's performance is very good.;;;
 I was wondering about the end, that is who will stay in this chance: D Have done a good film was a fun.;;;
A very warm, intimate movie. The fact that it is true makes the movie even more interesting. I respected Uluçay's genius and I thought that no deserving people in this sector have landed, where they have what possibilities and what they have, and also with these facilities I have been doing it for years and also A.Uluçay has been doing things with impossibilities, warmth and hope.;;;
 those who say filming the movie can read the book. see that it is fantastic;;;
I've also watched a new movie I like to watch fun;;;
 is the best romantic comedy I've seen in recent times so cute;;;

At first I want to say that friends who are critical of this movie have gone to the axaba film What do they expect of a Hollywood film like perfect effects, excellent sound quality, or just a movie?"" The passion of cinema and the creativity and imagination required by the cinema, my friends' eyes are so blind to Hollywood movies that one of us doesn't think that one of us can make a nice film with limited budgets. There are not many features that you would expect as a movie (sound, music quality is obviously poor), but that intimacy attracts people with the kindness of those amateur players. and follow our friends who don't know We need filmmakers.";;;

If this is accomplished, however, the genius of the director and the idea of ??how powerful a gun can be, this message can be regarded as a threat because it encourages those who are concerned about the violence or the norms that are contrary to the norms of society.

I'm embarrassed for Oliver Stone because he made such a bad film while watching it. A funny, childish, fake and simple film that fooled the audience as a fool (seizing the message) and troubled the media critique with the concern of the message he had infused. With Oliver Stone, who finally tore Tarantino's script out of such a reality and made it into a funny movie.
